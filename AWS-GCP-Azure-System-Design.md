# Design a Cloud Serives Provider like AWS/GCP/Azure

System Requirements:
The Cloud Services platform should support:

1. **Resource Provisioning:**

Users can provision computing resources (virtual machines, containers).
Support for various computing types (e.g., CPU, GPU).

2. **Storage Services:**

Users can store and retrieve data (object storage, file storage, databases).
Scalable and durable storage solutions.
3. **Networking Services:**

Users can configure and manage network resources (load balancers, virtual networks).
Support for private and public networking.

4. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**

Secure user authentication and authorization.
Role-based access control (RBAC).

5. **Monitoring and Logging:**

Logging and monitoring services for resource usage and application performance.
Integration with popular monitoring tools.
6. **Scalability and Elasticity:**

Ability to scale resources up or down based on demand.
Auto-scaling mechanisms for dynamic workloads.
7. **Fault Tolerance and High Availability:**

Redundancy and failover mechanisms for critical components.
Data replication and backup strategies.

8. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:**

Service discovery for distributed architectures.
Load balancing to distribute incoming traffic.

9. **Developer Tools:**

SDKs, APIs, and developer-friendly tools for easy integration.
Support for popular programming languages and frameworks.
10. **Billing and Metering:**

Metered billing based on resource consumption.
Transparent cost tracking and reporting.

## Core Use Cases:

1. **Resource Provisioning:**

Users can provision virtual machines, containers, and other computing resources.
Specify resource configurations, such as CPU, memory, and storage.
2. **Data Storage and Retrieval:**

Users can store and retrieve data using various storage services.
Support for object storage, file storage, and databases.
3. **Network Configuration:**

Users can configure virtual networks, load balancers, and other network resources.
Ensure security and isolation between different user environments.
4. **Identity and Access Management:**

Secure user authentication and authorization.
Define roles and permissions for users and services.

5. **Monitoring and Logging:**

Provide tools for users to monitor resource usage and application performance.
Centralized logging for better troubleshooting.

6. **Scaling Resources:**

Auto-scaling based on predefined metrics and policies.
Seamless scaling without downtime.

7. **Fault Tolerance:**

Redundancy for critical components to ensure high availability.
Rapid recovery from failures without data loss.

8. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:**

Efficient service discovery for distributed applications.
Load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances.
## Key Classes:

1. **CloudSystemService:**

Manages the overall operations of the cloud services platform.

2. **UserResource:**

Represents a user and manages their provisioned resources.

3. **StorageService:**

Represents various storage services (object storage, file storage, databases).

4. **NetworkService:**

Manages network-related configurations and resources.

5. **IdentityService:**

Handles user authentication, authorization, and identity management.

6. **MonitoringService:**

Provides tools for monitoring and logging.

7. **ScalingService:**

Manages auto-scaling and resource scaling.

8. **FaultToleranceService:**

Implements fault tolerance mechanisms.

9. **LoadBalancingService:**

Manages load balancing and service discovery.

10. **DeveloperTools:**

Includes SDKs, APIs, and developer-friendly tools.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

// Forward declarations
class User;
class StorageService;

// Represents a user on the cloud services platform
class User {
public:
    User(std::string username) : username(username) {}

    // Provision resources for the user
    void provisionResources(int cpu, int memory, int storage) {
        // Implement resource provisioning logic
        std::cout << "Provisioning resources for user " << username << std::endl;
    }

    // Access storage service
    StorageService& getStorageService() {
        // Return a reference to the user's storage service
        return storageService;
    }

private:
    std::string username;
    StorageService storageService;
    // Add more attributes and methods as needed
};

// Represents a storage service
class StorageService {
public:
    // Store data
    void storeData(const std::string& data) {
        // Implement data storage logic
        std::cout << "Storing data: " << data << std::endl;
    }

    // Retrieve data
    std::string retrieveData() {
        // Implement data retrieval logic
        return "Sample data";
    }

    // Add more storage-related methods as needed
};

// Main class representing the Cloud Services platform
class CloudServicesPlatform {
public:
    // Map to store users
    std::unordered_map<std::string, User> users;

    // Create a new user
    void createUser(const std::string& username) {
        users.emplace(username, User(username));
        std::cout << "User " << username << " created." << std::endl;
    }

    // Get user by username
    User& getUser(const std::string& username) {
        return users.at(username);
    }

    // Add more methods as needed

private:
    // Add more components and services as needed
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    CloudServicesPlatform cloudPlatform;

    cloudPlatform.createUser("Alice");
    cloudPlatform.createUser("Bob");

    User& alice = cloudPlatform.getUser("Alice");
    alice.provisionResources(2, 4096, 10240);

    StorageService& aliceStorage = alice.getStorageService();
    aliceStorage.storeData("Hello, Cloud!");

    std::string retrievedData = aliceStorage.retrieveData();
    std::cout << "Retrieved data: " << retrievedData << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
