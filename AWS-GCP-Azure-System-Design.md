# Design a Cloud Serives Provider like AWS/GCP/Azure

System Requirements:
The Cloud Services platform should support:

1. **Resource Provisioning:**

Users can provision computing resources (virtual machines, containers).
Support for various computing types (e.g., CPU, GPU).

2. **Storage Services:**

Users can store and retrieve data (object storage, file storage, databases).
Scalable and durable storage solutions.

3. **Networking Services:**

Users can configure and manage network resources (load balancers, virtual networks).
Support for private and public networking.

4. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**

Secure user authentication and authorization.
Role-based access control (RBAC).

5. **Monitoring and Logging:**

Logging and monitoring services for resource usage and application performance.
Integration with popular monitoring tools.

6. **Scalability and Elasticity:**

Ability to scale resources up or down based on demand.
Auto-scaling mechanisms for dynamic workloads.

7. **Fault Tolerance and High Availability:**

Redundancy and failover mechanisms for critical components.
Data replication and backup strategies.

8. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:**

Service discovery for distributed architectures.
Load balancing to distribute incoming traffic.

9. **Developer Tools:**

SDKs, APIs, and developer-friendly tools for easy integration.
Support for popular programming languages and frameworks.

10. **Billing and Metering:**

Metered billing based on resource consumption.
Transparent cost tracking and reporting.

## Core Use Cases:

1. **Resource Provisioning:**

Users can provision virtual machines, containers, and other computing resources.
Specify resource configurations, such as CPU, memory, and storage.

2. **Data Storage and Retrieval:**

Users can store and retrieve data using various storage services.
Support for object storage, file storage, and databases.

3. **Network Configuration:**

Users can configure virtual networks, load balancers, and other network resources.
Ensure security and isolation between different user environments.

4. **Identity and Access Management:**

Secure user authentication and authorization.
Define roles and permissions for users and services.

5. **Monitoring and Logging:**

Provide tools for users to monitor resource usage and application performance.
Centralized logging for better troubleshooting.

6. **Scaling Resources:**

Auto-scaling based on predefined metrics and policies.
Seamless scaling without downtime.

7. **Fault Tolerance:**

Redundancy for critical components to ensure high availability.
Rapid recovery from failures without data loss.

8. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:**

Efficient service discovery for distributed applications.
Load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances.
## Key Classes:

5. **IdentityService:**

Handles user authentication, authorization, and identity management.

6. **MonitoringService:**

Provides tools for monitoring and logging.

7. **ScalingService:**

Manages auto-scaling and resource scaling.

8. **FaultToleranceService:**

Implements fault tolerance mechanisms.

9. **LoadBalancingService:**

Manages load balancing and service discovery.

10. **DeveloperTools:**

Includes SDKs, APIs, and developer-friendly tools.
