Designing the system for creating and reading tweets in a Twitter-like application involves several components. Here's an overview of the key components and their functionalities:

1. User Interface and Frontend:
- Develop a user-friendly web or mobile interface for users to create and read tweets.
- Implement features like composing tweets, displaying the timeline/feed, and user profiles.

2. Authentication and User Management:
- Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the application.
- Allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

3. Tweet Storage:
- Design a database system to store tweets and associated metadata.
- Each tweet should have attributes such as content, timestamp, author ID, likes, retweets, and comments.

4. Tweet Creation:
- Implement the functionality to create and post tweets.
- Validate and process the tweet content, enforce character limits, and handle multimedia attachments if supported.

5. Timeline/Feed Generation:
- Design a system to generate and display a user's timeline/feed, which includes tweets from followed users.
- Store and update relationships between users, allowing users to follow/unfollow others.

6. Tweet Retrieval:
- Enable users to retrieve tweets based on various criteria, such as their own tweets, tweets from specific users, or tweets with specific hashtags.
- Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large volumes of tweets.

7. Real-time Updates:
- Implement real-time updates for new tweets and interactions (likes, retweets, comments) using technologies like WebSockets or server-sent events.
- Push notifications can be utilized to alert users about relevant activities.

8. Hashtag Indexing and Search:
- Implement a system to index and search tweets based on hashtags.
- Enable users to search for tweets containing specific hashtags or keywords.

9. User Interactions:
- Implement functionalities like liking, retweeting, and commenting on tweets.
- Store and update user interactions to maintain accurate counts and enable personalized feeds.

10. Spam and Abuse Prevention:
- Design mechanisms to prevent and detect spam, abusive content, or inappropriate behavior.
- Implement features like reporting, content moderation, and automated detection algorithms.

11. Analytics and Monitoring:
- Incorporate analytics tools to gather insights about user activity, engagement, and system performance.
- Monitor key metrics such as tweet views, likes, and user interactions to understand user behavior.

12. Scalability and Performance:
- Design the system to handle a high volume of tweet creation and retrieval requests.
- Consider horizontal scaling, caching strategies, and load balancing techniques to ensure optimal performance.

Remember that this is a high-level overview, and there are additional considerations and optimizations based on specific requirements, such as handling media attachments, trending topics, user notifications, and privacy settings. The choice of technologies, frameworks, and infrastructure will depend on factors like scalability goals, development stack familiarity, and performance requirements.

            for (const auto& tweet : users[followedUser].tweets) {
                timeline.push_back(tweets.back());
            }
        }
        // Sort timeline by timestamp (not shown for simplicity)
    }
    return timeline;
}

int main() {
    // Creating users
    createUser("user1");
    createUser("user2");

    // User1 posts a tweet
    postTweet("user1", "Hello, Twitter!");

    // User2 follows User1
    users["user2"].following.push_back("user1");

    // User2 posts a tweet
    postTweet("user2", "Following user1's first tweet!");

    // User1 gets their timeline
    std::vector<Tweet> user1Timeline = getTimeline("user1");

    // Display User1's timeline
    std::cout << "User1's Timeline:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& tweet : user1Timeline) {
        std::cout << tweet.author << ": " << tweet.content << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
