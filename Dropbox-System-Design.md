# Designing an File System like Dropbox and Google Drive

In this article, we will explore the object-oriented design and implementation of a Restaurant Management System using Java. 
System Requirements:

## User Account Management:

Allow users to create accounts, log in, and log out.
Manage user profiles, preferences, and access control.

1. **File and Folder Management:**

Enable users to upload, download, and delete files.
Support organizing files into folders and subfolders.
Implement file versioning and history.

2. **Sharing and Collaboration:**

Allow users to share files/folders with others.
Support collaborative editing and real-time synchronization.
Implement permission settings for shared items.

3. **Syncing Across Devices:**

Provide desktop and mobile clients for cross-device syncing.
Ensure seamless integration with various operating systems.

4. **Security and Encryption:**

Implement secure data transmission (SSL/TLS).
Encrypt user data on servers and in transit.
Provide features like two-factor authentication.
5. **Search Functionality:**

Implement a robust search feature for quick file retrieval.
Support advanced search based on file metadata.

6. **Offline Access:**

Allow users to mark files for offline access.
Implement efficient offline synchronization.

7. **Notification System:**

Notify users about file changes, shares, and collaboration activities.
Support email and in-app notifications.

8. **Subscription Management:**

Handle subscription plans, billing, and payment processing.
Allow users to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel subscriptions.

9. **Audit Trail and Logging:**

Maintain an audit trail for user actions and system changes.
Log relevant events for security and debugging purposes.

## Core Use Cases:

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**

Users can create accounts, log in, and log out securely.

2. **Uploading and Downloading Files:**

Users can upload files to the cloud and download them.

3. **File and Folder Organization:**

Users can create folders, organize files, and manage file versions.

4. **Sharing and Collaboration:**

Users can share files/folders and collaborate in real-time.

5. **Syncing Across Devices:**

Changes made on one device are synced across all linked devices.

6. **Security Measures:**

Ensuring secure data transmission and storage.

7. **Search Functionality:**

Users can search for files based on metadata.

8. **Offline Access:**

Users can access certain files offline.

9. **Notification Handling:**

Users receive notifications about relevant activities.

10. **Subscription Management:**

Users can manage their subscription plans.

## Key Classes:

1. **CloudStorageSystem:**

Manages overall operations, user accounts, and subscriptions.

2. **User:**

Represents a user with account details and preferences.

3. **File:**

Represents an uploaded file with metadata and versioning.

4. **Folder:**

Represents a folder containing files and subfolders.

5. **SharingManager:**

Manages file/folder sharing and collaboration.

6. **SyncManager:**

Handles syncing and offline access.

7. **SecurityManager:**

Implements security measures like encryption.

8. **NotificationSystem:**

Manages notification generation and delivery.
9. **SubscriptionManager:**

Handles subscription plans and billing.

10. **AuditLogger:**

Logs user actions and system events for auditing.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <ctime>

// User class representing a user account
class User {
public:
    std::string username;
    std::string password;
    // Other user details

    User(const std::string& uname, const std::string& pwd)
        : username(uname), password(pwd) {}
};

// File class representing an uploaded file
class File {
public:
    std::string name;
    std::string content;
    time_t lastModified;

    File(const std::string& fname, const std::string& fcontent)
        : name(fname), content(fcontent) {
        lastModified = time(nullptr);
    }
};

// CloudStorageSystem class managing overall operations
class CloudStorageSystem {
private:
    std::map<std::string, User> users;
    std::map<std::string, std::vector<File>> userFiles;

        userFiles[username] = std::vector<File>();
    }

    bool loginUser(const std::string& username, const std::string& password) {
        auto it = users.find(username);
        return it != users.end() && it->second.password == password;
    }

    void uploadFile(const std::string& username, const std::string& filename, const std::string& content) {
        if (users.find(username) != users.end()) {
            userFiles[username].emplace_back(filename, content);
            std::cout << "File '" << filename << "' uploaded successfully.\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "User not found. Please log in.\n";
        }
    }

    void listUserFiles(const std::string& username) {
        if (users.find(username) != users.end()) {

            for (const auto& file : userFiles[username]) {
                std::cout << file.name << " (Last Modified: " << ctime(&file.lastModified) << ")\n";
            }
        } else {
            std::cout << "User not found. Please log in.\n";
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    CloudStorageSystem cloudStorage;

    // Register users
    cloudStorage.registerUser("user1", "password1");
    cloudStorage.registerUser("user2", "password2");

    // Login users
    if (cloudStorage.loginUser("user1", "password1")) {
        std::cout << "User1 logged in successfully.\n";

        // Upload files
        cloudStorage.uploadFile("user1", "file1.txt", "File content 1");
        cloudStorage.uploadFile("user1", "file2.txt", "File content 2");

        // List user files
        cloudStorage.listUserFiles("user1");
    } else {
        std::cout << "Login failed for User1.\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
