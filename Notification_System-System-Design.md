Designing a notification system involves creating a robust and efficient mechanism to deliver timely notifications to users. Here's an outline of the key components and functionalities for designing a notification system:

1. Event Triggering and Processing:
- Identify the events that will trigger notifications (e.g., new message, comment, like, friend request, system update).
- Set up event listeners to capture and process these events in real-time or asynchronously.

2. Notification Service:
- Develop a dedicated notification service responsible for handling notification logic.
- Store notification data, including the recipient, content, timestamp, and event details.

3. User Preferences and Settings:
- Allow users to define their notification preferences and settings (e.g., email, push notification, in-app alert).
- Implement mechanisms to manage the frequency and types of notifications users want to receive.

4. Delivery Channels:
- Support various delivery channels for notifications, such as email, push notifications (for mobile apps), SMS, and in-app alerts.
- Integrate with third-party notification providers or cloud services for each delivery channel.

5. Message Queue (Optional):
- Utilize a message queue to handle notification processing asynchronously, ensuring system responsiveness and scalability.
- Popular message queues include Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Amazon SQS.

6. Real-Time WebSockets (Optional):
- For real-time notifications, consider implementing WebSockets to push updates directly to connected clients.
- WebSockets enable instant notifications without the need for constant polling.

7. Notification Templates:
- Create notification templates to customize the appearance and content of different types of notifications.
- Use dynamic placeholders to insert personalized user data into the notification content.

8. Batch Processing (Optional):
- Consider batch processing for scenarios where users receive multiple notifications simultaneously.
- Batch notifications can reduce the number of delivery requests and improve system efficiency.

9. Notification History and Read Status:
- Maintain a record of sent notifications and their delivery status (e.g., delivered, failed).
- Track whether users have viewed or interacted with each notification.

10. Analytics and Monitoring:
- Implement analytics to track notification engagement, delivery rates, and user interactions.
- Set up monitoring to detect and respond to issues like delivery failures or performance bottlenecks.

11. Security and Privacy:
- Ensure that the notification system adheres to security best practices to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- Respect user privacy settings and provide options to opt-out of specific notification types.

12. Scalability and Load Balancing:
- Design the system to handle a large number of notifications for a growing user base.
- Use load balancing and horizontal scaling to distribute the load across multiple servers or instances.

13. Testing and Error Handling:
- Implement thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and load tests, to validate the notification system's reliability and performance.
- Handle errors gracefully and implement retries for delivery failures.

Remember that the specific implementation details and technologies used will depend on your application's requirements, the platform you are targeting (web, mobile, etc.), and the scalability goals. Regularly monitor the system's performance and user feedback to continuously improve the notification experience for users.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

// Notification Event
struct NotificationEvent {
    std::string eventType;
    // Additional event details as needed
};

// Notification
struct Notification {
    std::string recipient;
    std::string content;
    std::string timestamp;
    NotificationEvent event;
    bool isRead;

    // Constructor
    Notification(std::string recipient, std::string content, std::string timestamp, NotificationEvent event)
        : recipient(std::move(recipient)), content(std::move(content)), timestamp(std::move(timestamp)), event(std::move(event)), isRead(false) {}
};

// Notification Service
class NotificationService {
private:
    // Store notifications by user
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<Notification>> notificationStore;

public:
    // Send notification to a user
    void sendNotification(const Notification& notification) {
        notificationStore[notification.recipient].push_back(notification);
    }

    // Get unread notifications for a user
    std::vector<Notification> getUnreadNotifications(const std::string& user) const {
        std::vector<Notification> unreadNotifications;
        auto it = notificationStore.find(user);
        if (it != notificationStore.end()) {
            for (const auto& notification : it->second) {
                if (!notification.isRead) {
                    unreadNotifications.push_back(notification);
                }
            }
        }
        return unreadNotifications;
    }

    // Mark a notification as read
    void markAsRead(const std::string& user, const Notification& notification) {
        auto it = notificationStore.find(user);
        if (it != notificationStore.end()) {
            for (auto& storedNotification : it->second) {
                if (storedNotification.content == notification.content && !storedNotification.isRead) {
                    storedNotification.isRead = true;
                    std::cout << "Notification marked as read: " << storedNotification.content << std::endl;
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
        std::cout << "Notification not found or already read." << std::endl;

    Notification notification1(user1, "You have a new message", "2024-01-27 12:00:00", newMessageEvent);
    Notification notification2(user2, "Friend request received", "2024-01-27 13:30:00", {"Friend Request"});

    // Sending Notifications
    notificationService.sendNotification(notification1);
    notificationService.sendNotification(notification2);

    // Viewing Unread Notifications
    auto unreadNotificationsUser1 = notificationService.getUnreadNotifications(user1);
    auto unreadNotificationsUser2 = notificationService.getUnreadNotifications(user2);

    std::cout << "Unread notifications for user1:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& notification : unreadNotificationsUser1) {
        std::cout << notification.content << std::endl;
    }

    std::cout << "Unread notifications for user2:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& notification : unreadNotificationsUser2) {
        std::cout << notification.content << std::endl;
    }

    // Marking Notifications as Read
    notificationService.markAsRead(user1, notification1);
    notificationService.markAsRead(user2, notification2);

    return 0;
