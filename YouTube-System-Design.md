Designing a system for YouTube-like upload and streaming of videos involves several components and considerations. Here's an overview of the key components and their functionalities:

1. User Interface and Frontend:
- Develop a user-friendly web or mobile interface for users to upload videos.
- Implement features like video selection, metadata entry (title, description, tags), and upload progress tracking.

2. Video Upload Service:
- Create an upload service to handle incoming video files from users.
- Implement file validation, security checks, and metadata extraction.
- Store the uploaded videos in blob storage, such as Azure Blob Storage or Amazon S3.

3. Video Processing and Transcoding:
- Implement a video processing pipeline to handle video transcoding and optimization.
- Convert uploaded videos into multiple formats and bitrates suitable for streaming across different devices and network conditions.
- Leverage encoding tools or services like FFmpeg or AWS Elemental MediaConvert for efficient transcoding.

4. Metadata Management:
- Design a metadata management system to store and retrieve video metadata efficiently.
- Consider using a database or distributed storage solution for storing metadata associated with each video, including titles, descriptions, tags, and user information.

5. Content Delivery Network (CDN):
- Integrate a CDN, such as Akamai or Cloudflare, to cache and distribute video content globally.
- Utilize CDN edge servers to reduce latency and handle high-volume concurrent video requests from users.

6. Video Streaming Service:
- Develop a video streaming service to deliver videos to end-users.
- Implement adaptive streaming techniques (e.g., HTTP Live Streaming - HLS or Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP - DASH) to enable seamless video playback across different devices and network conditions.
- Utilize video player libraries or frameworks (e.g., Video.js, Plyr, or JW Player) to handle video playback in the frontend.

7. Video Recommendations and Search:
- Implement recommendation algorithms to suggest relevant videos to users based on their viewing history, preferences, or popular trends.
- Integrate search functionality to allow users to search for videos based on titles, descriptions, or tags.

8. User Management and Authentication:
- Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the upload and access to videos.
- Provide user management features, including user profiles, subscriptions, and notifications.

9. Analytics and Monitoring:
- Incorporate analytics and monitoring tools to gather insights about video performance, user engagement, and system health.
- Monitor key metrics like video views, playback errors, and user feedback to identify areas for improvement.

10. Scalability and Load Balancing:
- Design the system to handle a high volume of video uploads and concurrent video streaming requests.
- Utilize load balancers, horizontal scaling, and distributed architectures to distribute the workload across multiple servers or instances.

Remember that building a YouTube-like system requires careful consideration of scalability, performance, security, and user experience. The specific technologies, frameworks, and infrastructure choices may vary based on your preferences, available resources, and technical requirements.

                    }

                    // Extract video data from the request body

                            }
                        });
                }
            });
    }

    void processVideoData(std::size_t length) {
        // Process the video data (e.g., store in a file)
        std::ofstream videoFile("uploaded_video.mp4", std::ios::binary);
        videoFile.write(videoData_.data(), static_cast<std::streamsize>(length));
        std::cout << "Video uploaded successfully." << std::endl;
    }

    boost::asio::ip::tcp::acceptor acceptor_;
    boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket socket_;
    boost::asio::streambuf request_;
    std::string videoData_;
};

int main() {
    try {
        boost::asio::io_context ioContext;
        VideoUploadServer server(ioContext, 8080);
        ioContext.run();
    } catch (std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
