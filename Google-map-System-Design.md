# Designing Google map 
## System Requirements:
User Profile Management:

## Creating User Profiles:

Users can create accounts with details like name, email, and profile pictures.
Optional: Allow users to set preferences for map themes, favorites, etc.

## Updating User Profiles:

Users can update their profiles, including changing profile pictures or updating personal information.

## Map Navigation:

## Viewing Maps:

Users should be able to view maps with different layers (e.g., standard, satellite, terrain).
Implement zoom and pan functionalities for map exploration.

## Location Sharing:

Users can share their current location in real-time with friends.
Users can view the real-time locations of their friends on the map.
## Route Planning:

Allow users to input a starting point and destination to get directions and recommended routes.
## Search Functionality:

Users can search for places, addresses, or points of interest on the map.
## Favorite Places:

Allow users to save favorite locations and view them on the map.
Core Use Cases:
## User Registration:

Users can create accounts with a unique username, email, and password.
## User Authentication:

Securely authenticate users during login.
## Profile Creation:

Users can create profiles with details like name, email, and profile pictures.
## Profile Update:

Enable users to update their profiles, including changing profile pictures.
## Map Exploration:

Users can explore maps, switch between map layers, and use zoom and pan features.
## Location Sharing:

Users can share their real-time location with friends.
Users can view the real-time locations of their friends on the map.
## Route Planning:

Users can input starting and destination points to get directions and view recommended routes.
## Search for Places:

Users can search for places, addresses, or points of interest on the map.
Save Favorite Places:

Users can save favorite locations and view them later on the map.
Key Classes:
MapSystem:

Manages the overall map-related operations.
Coordinates interactions between different components.
User:

Represents a user account with attributes like username, email, and profile information.
Contains methods for creating, updating, and viewing profiles.
LocationSharingService:

Manages the real-time location sharing functionality.
RoutePlanningService:

Handles route planning, directions, and recommended routes.
SearchService:

Implements search functionality for places, addresses, and points of interest.
FavoritePlacesManager:

Manages the saving and viewing of favorite locations.
