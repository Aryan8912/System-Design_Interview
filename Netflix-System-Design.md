4. **Offline Viewing:**

Allow users to download content for offline viewing.
Manage downloaded content securely and efficiently.
5. **Recommendation System:**

Provide personalized content recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
6. **Search Functionality:**

Implement a robust search feature to help users find specific movies or TV shows.
7. **Subscription Management:**

Handle subscription plans, billing, and payment processing.
Allow users to upgrade, downgrade, or cancel their subscription.
8. **Social Features:**

Implement social features such as sharing, liking, and commenting on content.
Enable users to see what their friends are watching.
## Core Use Cases:
1. **User Registration and Authentication:**

Users can create accounts, log in, and log out securely.
2. **Browsing and Searching:**

Users can browse the content catalog, search for specific titles, and view details.
3. **Video Playback:**

Users can play, pause, resume, and stop video playback.
4. **Offline Viewing:**

Users can download content for offline viewing and manage downloads.
5. **Recommendation System:**

Users receive personalized content recommendations.
6. **Subscription Management:**

Users can manage their subscription plans, billing, and payment details.
7. **Social Interaction:**

Users can engage in social features like sharing, liking, and commenting on content.
## Key Classes:
StreamingServiceSystem:

Manages the overall streaming service.
Coordinates interactions between different components.
1. **User:**

Represents a user account with information like username, password, and preferences.
2. **ContentCatalog:**

Manages the catalog of movies and TV shows.
Categorizes content and provides details for display.
3. **VideoPlayer:**

Handles video playback functionalities such as play, pause, and stop.
4. **DownloadManager:**

Manages the downloading and storage of content for offline viewing.
5. **RecommendationEngine:**

Generates personalized content recommendations for users.
6. **SubscriptionManager:**

Manages subscription plans, billing, and payment processing.
7. **SocialInteractionHandler:**

Handles social features like sharing, liking, and commenting.
This design provides a foundation for building a streaming service and can be further expanded and refined based on specific requirements and technical considerations.
