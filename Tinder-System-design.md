Provide options for users to modify their relationship preferences.
Viewing User Profiles:

Users should be able to view profiles of others.
Profiles may include pictures, bio, interests, and relationship preferences.
Matching and Connection:

User Authentication:

Securely authenticate users during login.
Profile Creation:

Allow users to create a profile with pictures, bio, and interests.
Specify relationship preferences (e.g., seeking men, women, both).
Profile Update:

Enable users to update their profiles, including adding/removing pictures and modifying bio.
Profile Viewing:

Users can view profiles of others, including pictures and bio.
Expressing Interest:

Implement features like swiping right to express interest in another user's profile.
Matching:

If two users express mutual interest, create a match and notify both users.
Messaging (Optional):

Allow matched users to communicate through a messaging system.
Key Classes:
DatingAppSystem:

Manages the overall operations of the dating app.
Coordinates interactions between different components.
User:

Represents a user account with attributes like name, age, and interests.
Contains methods for creating, updating, and viewing profiles.
UserProfile:

Manages the details of a user's profile, including pictures, bio, and interests.
Associated with the User class.
MatchingSystem:

Handles the logic for expressing interest, matching, and connecting users.
AuthenticationManager:

Handles user authentication during login.
Validates the user's credentials.
